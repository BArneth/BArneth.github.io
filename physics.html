# Entropy-Originated Topological Framework (EOTF)

**Author:** Borros  
**INSPIRE ID:** 2545933  
**Keywords:** entropy, topology, emergent gravity, unification  

The EOTF develops an operator-based, entropic-topological approach to unify matter and gravity.  
It connects QCD, the Standard Model, and gravitational interactions through projective operators in a diagram Hilbert space.
